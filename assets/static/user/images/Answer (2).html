                                        <div class="question">
                                            <div class="ugc-base question-body-text">
<div class=""><p>Suppose that 10 years ago you bought a home for $150,000, paying
10% as a down payment, and financing the rest at 8% interest for 30
years.</p>
<p>1.How much money did you pay as your down payment?</p>
<p>15000</p>
<p>2. How much money was your existing mortgage (loan) for?</p>
<p>135000</p>
<p>3. What is your current monthly payment on your existing
mortgage? Note: Carry at least 4 decimal places during
calculations, but round your final answer to the nearest cent. 4.
How much total interest will you pay over the life of the existing
loan?</p>
<p>990.51 (not sure if its correct)</p>
<p>5. This year (10 years after you first took out the loan), you
check your loan balance. Only part of your payments have been going
to pay down the loan; the rest has been going towards interest. You
see that you still have $118,428 left to pay on your loan. Your
house is now valued at $180,000. How much of the original loan have
you paid off? (i.e, how much have you reduced the loan balance by?
Keep in mind that interest is charged each month – it’s not part of
the loan balance.)</p>
<p>6. How much money have you paid to the loan company so far (over
the last 10 years)?</p>
<p>7. How much interest have you paid so far (over the last 10
years)?</p>
<p>8. How much equity do you have in your home (equity is value
minus remaining debt)?</p>
<p>9. Since interest rates have dropped, you consider refinancing
your mortgage at a lower 6% rate. If you took out a new 30 year
mortgage at 6% for your remaining loan balance, what would your new
monthly payments be?</p>
<p>10. How much interest will you pay over the life of the new
loan?</p>
<p>11. Notice that if you refinance, you are going to be making
payments on your home for another 30 years. In addition to the 10
years you’ve already been paying, that’s 40 years total. How much
will you save each month because of the lower monthly payment?</p>
<p>12. How much total interest will you be paying (consider the
interest you paid over the first 10 years of your original loan as
well as interest on your refinanced loan)?</p>
<p>13. Now the non-computational question: Does it make sense to
refinance? (There isn’t a correct answer to this question. Just
give your opinion and your reason.)</p>
