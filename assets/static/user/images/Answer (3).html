<div class=""><p>Suppose that 10 years ago you bought a home for $150,000, paying
10% as a down payment, and financing the rest at 7% interest for 30
years.</p>
<p>This year (10 years after you first took out the loan), you
check your loan balance. Only part of your payments have been going
to pay down the loan; the rest has been going towards interest. You
see that you still have $115,847 left to pay on your loan. Your
house is now valued at $200,000.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Your current situation</strong><br/>
How much of the original loan have you paid off? (i.e, how much
have you reduced the loan balance by? Keep in mind that interest is
charged each month - it's not part of the loan balance.</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>How much money have you paid to the loan company so far (over
the last 10 years)?</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>How much interest have you paid so far (over the last 10
years)?</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>How much equity do you have in your home (equity is value minus
remaining debt)</p>
<p>$</p>
<p><strong>Refinancing</strong><br/>
<br/>
Since interest rates have dropped, you consider refinancing your
mortgage at a lower 6% rate.<br/>
<br/>
If you took out a new 30 year mortgage at 6% for your remaining
loan balance, what would your new monthly payments be?</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>How much interest will you pay over the life of the new
loan?</p>

<p>Down payment = 10% of $150000 = $15000</p>
<p>So Loan taken = $150000 - $15000 = $135000</p>
<p>Monthly interest rate = 7%/12 = 0.5833% or 0.005833</p>
<p>No. of payments = 12*30 = 360</p>
<p>Monthly Installment A is calculated as</p>
<p>A/0.005833 * (1-1/1.005833^360) = 135000</p>
<p>=&gt; A*150.3075679 = 135000</p>
<p>=&gt; A = $898.1584</p>
<p>As the balance iss $115847 , whereas the original loan taken was
$135000 , the loan amount which has been paid off = $135000-
$115847 = <strong>$19153</strong></p>
<p>Total Amount paid in last 10 years = $898.1584 * 120 =
<strong>$107,779</strong></p>
<p>So, Interest paid in last 10 years = $107779 - $19153 =
<strong>$88626</strong></p>
<p>Equity = Home value - loan remaining</p>
<p>= $200000 - $115847 = <strong>$84153</strong></p>
<p>New Monthly loan payments (A)  for a loan amount of
$115847 at a rate of 6% per annum or 0.5% per month for 30 years or
360 months is given by</p>
<p>A/0.005 * (1-1/1.005^360) = 115847</p>
<p>=&gt; A*166.7916 = 115847</p>
<p>=&gt; A = <strong>$694.5596</strong></p>
<p>Total Amount paid in new loan = $694.5596 * 360 = $250041.46 or

<p>So, Interest paid in new loan = $250041 - $115847 =
