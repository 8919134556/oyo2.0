<p>2. BLACKJACK! (50 PTS)<br/>
Write a script to play a simple game of Blackjack. The rules
are:<br/>
• Each round costs the player $1<br/>
• Aces are worth 11 to start, but if the total is over 21, can be
changed into a 1.<br/>
• A round starts with giving two cards to the player.<br/>
• The dealer must always draw until they reach a card total of 17
or are over 21 (busted). If the later occurs,<br/>
the round is over.<br/>
• In the event the dealer is not busted at the start of the round,
the player can either take a card or end the<br/>
round (called standing)<br/>
• The round continues with the player sequentially taking cards
until they decide to stop or are busted.<br/>
• At the end of the round, whoever is closer to a total of 21
without going over, wins. In the event of a tie,<br/>
the player gets $1.<br/>
• If the player wins, they get $1.50</p>
<p>• The game continues until the player decides to quit the
game</p>
